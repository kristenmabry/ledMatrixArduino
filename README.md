# LED Matrix - Arduino

This is the Arduino code for the LED Bluetooh Sign Project
 - The HC-05 Bluetooth module reads incoming data and turns it into a text layout for the LED matrix to display
 
 To Do:
  - The bt module will send the current text when requested
  - the current text will be saved in EEPROM to restore previous text when turning Arduino off and on
